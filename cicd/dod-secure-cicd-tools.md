2. **Configuration**: YAML for configuration files
3. **APIs**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specifications
4. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with OIDC for service authentication
5. **Storage**: PostgreSQL for structured data, S3-compatible storage for artifacts
6. **Messaging**: Kafka or NATS for event-driven architectures
7. **Containerization**: Docker with Kubernetes orchestration
8. **Secrets**: HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for secrets

### 4.3 Security Requirements

All custom tools must meet the following security requirements:

1. **Secure Development**: Follow secure coding practices and SSDLC
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security scanning of tool codebases
3. **Dependency Management**: Strict management of dependencies
4. **Least Privilege**: Tools should operate with minimal privileges
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
6. **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all inputs
7. **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding of outputs to prevent injection
8. **Encryption**: Encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest
9. **Authentication**: Strong authentication for all tool interactions
