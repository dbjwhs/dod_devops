## Document Navigation Guide

For a complete understanding of the DoD-compliant CI/CD pipeline implementation, it is recommended to read the documents in the following order:

1. Start with the **Main Implementation Guide** to understand the overall architecture and approach
2. Review the **Zero Trust Implementation** to understand the security foundation
3. Study the **Multi-Tier Code Review Process** to understand the approval workflow
4. Review the **Tools and Integrations** document to understand the toolchain components
5. Examine the **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Example** for practical implementation details

## Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to track your implementation progress:
