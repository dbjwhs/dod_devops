## 1. Introduction

The multi-tier code review process is a critical security control in DoD-compliant CI/CD pipelines that ensures code meets security requirements before deployment. This process implements a defense-in-depth approach by requiring sequential approval from multiple roles with increasing authority levels.

Key benefits of this approach include:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Multiple review layers catch more security issues
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets DoD requirements for code verification
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Encourages cross-team collaboration and knowledge transfer
4. **Quality Assurance**: Improves overall code quality through diverse perspectives
5. **Accountability**: Creates clear approval chains with documented decisions

## 2. Three-Tier Review Framework

The multi-tier review process follows a sequential approval workflow with increasing authority levels:

    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Code Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM',
                    branches: [[name: '*/main']],
                    extensions: [[$class: 'CloneOption',
                        noTags: false,
                        shallow: false,
                        depth: 0,
                        reference: '']],
                    userRemoteConfigs: [[
                        url: 'https://github.com/organization/repository.git',
                        refspec: '+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main'

        }

        stage('Peer Review Verification') {
            steps {
                // Verify that peer review has been completed
                script {
                    def peerReviewStatus = sh(script: 'code-review-status-checker --level=peer', returnStdout: true).trim()
                    if (peerReviewStatus != 'APPROVED') {
                        error "Peer review has not been completed or approved"
                    }

                    // Record peer review metadata
                    sh 'record-review-metadata --level=peer --pipeline-run=${BUILD_NUMBER}'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Security Gatekeeper Review Verification') {
            steps {
                // Verify that security gatekeeper review has been completed
                script {
                    def gatekeeperReviewStatus = sh(script: 'code-review-status-checker --level=security-gatekeeper', returnStdout: true).trim()
                    if (gatekeeperReviewStatus != 'APPROVED') {
                        error "Security Gatekeeper review has not been completed or approved"
                    }

                    // Record gatekeeper review metadata
                    sh 'record-review-metadata --level=security-gatekeeper --pipeline-run=${BUILD_NUMBER}'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Mission Owner Approval Verification') {
            steps {
                // Verify that Mission Owner approval has been granted
                script {
                    def moApprovalStatus = sh(script: 'code-review-status-checker --level=mission-owner', returnStdout: true).trim()
                    if (moApprovalStatus != 'APPROVED') {
                        error "Mission Owner approval has not been granted"
                    }

                    // Record MO approval metadata
                    sh 'record-review-metadata --level=mission-owner --pipeline-run=${BUILD_NUMBER}'

                    // Generate approval attestation
                    sh 'generate-approval-attestation --signers=${APPROVERS} --commit=${GIT_COMMIT}'
                }
            }
        }

        // Continue with build and deployment after all reviews are verified
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Building can proceed now that all reviews are confirmed

   - Code preparation for review
   - Security self-assessment
   - Documentation requirements
   - Responding to review feedback

2. **Security Awareness**
   - Secure coding practices
   - Common vulnerability prevention
   - DoD security requirements
   - Security control implementation

## 12. Conclusion

The multi-tier review process is a critical security control in DoD-compliant CI/CD pipelines. By implementing this structured approach with peer review, security gatekeeper review, and Mission Owner approval, organizations can:

1. Ensure code quality and security before deployment
2. Provide appropriate authorization for production releases
3. Document the approval chain for compliance requirements
4. Enable efficient development while maintaining security governance

This review framework should be tailored to specific organizational needs while maintaining the core principles of progressive review authority, security focus, and appropriate documentation.
